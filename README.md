# Roblox Group Fetcher
thing i made that gets someone's stats in a group. you would never need this but its really just for me

# uh api thing
the url is rbx-group-fetcher.pages.dev and this should be the body
``{
  "username": "ROBLOX",
  "groupId": 1
}``
or
``{
  "userId": 1,
  "groupId": 1
}``
the api should return something like this
``{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Builderman",
  "displayName": "builderman",
  "description": "Welcome to Roblox!",
  "created": "2006-03-08T16:34:00.613Z",
  "isBanned": false,
  "externalAppDisplayName": null,
  "groupContext": {
    "rank": 255,
    "role": "Owner"
  }
}``

# uh thats it
bye
